            <h4>Travelling Salesman Problem</h4>
            <p>
              The travelling salesman problem is the problem of finding the shortest 
              possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city.
              It does not have a known polynomial time solution. It is an NP-hard problem in
              combinatorial optimization, important in operations research and theoretical
              computer science. There are heuristic algorithms which can be used to find 'good' 
              solutions to the problem, or form upper/lower bounds but currently brute force is
              still needed to find the best solution. Applications include logistics, planning, 
              and the manufacture of microchips. These problems can be modelled as a graph.

            <h4>Chinese Postman Problem</h4>
            <p>The Chinese postman problem is the problem of finding the shortest closed path or circuit
            that visits every edge of a (connected) undirected or directed graph. It is also known as the 
            route inspection problem. Applications include mail delivery, garbage collection, snow plowing, and
            street sweeping. This problem can be solved in polynomial time by finding all vertices of odd degree,
            finding the minimum weight matching for these vertices, and adding these edges to the original graph. 
            So the optimal pairings of odd degree vertices are found and duplicated to make all vertices even degree.
            Then an Eulerian circuit can be found for the modified graph. A graph is Eulerian if all vertices have 
            even degree. If the condition that the start and end vertex are the same is relaxed, then the problem is known as the
            rural postman problem. Here, the graph must have exactly two vertices of odd degree (semi-Eulerian).

            <h4>Shortest Path Point to Point</h4>
            <p>The shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a graph
            such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized. It can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm.
            This is a greedy algorithm that works by maintaining a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the source is known and 
            repeatedly selecting the node with the smallest known distance, updating the distances of its neighbors, and adding it to 
            the set of known nodes. Applications include routing and navigation problems, such as finding the shortest route for 
            delivery trucks, or for network routing protocols to determine the best path for data packets to travel across a network. 
            This problem can be solved in polynomial time.
