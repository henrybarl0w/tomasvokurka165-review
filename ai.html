            <p class="mg-text">
                AI, standing for Artificial Intelligence, is intelligence that is artificially created to solve problems. AI is a very broad term and encompasses everything from simple game AIs to multi-level neural networks. 
                The main idea behind artificial intelligence is mathematics, especially concerning Linear Algebra and Caculus. Research around AI truly began in the 1950s after a workshop was held on the campus of Dartmouth
                College. The US government provided millions in funding as the very same attendees of the workshop became the main AI researchers of their decades. Eventually, after multiple AI "winters" where research stalled, these 
                very foundations lead to the creation of machine learning, deep learning and the Large Language Models which boomed in the 2020s.

                <p>
                    Artificial Narrow Intelligence (or ANI), often also refered to as Weak AI or Narrow AI, is an AI that can be trained for a specific task, usually excelling in that task even compared to other 
                    humans. This is also the only intelligence that currently exists. Despite its utility, ChatGPT is considered a Narrow AI due to its limited input facilities.<sup>[1]</sup> Narrow AI is considered dangerous in some ways
                    due to its unpredictability. Although things like Autocorrection, speech recoginition and contributions to data science (all examples of narrow AI), Narrow AI has also caused discrimination in workplaces as well
                    as death via autonomous driving. <sup>[2]</sup>

                <p>
                    Artificial General Intelligence (or AGI), often called Strong AI, is an AI that would be capable of virtually all tasks human can accomplish, matching or surpassing human capability in these tasks. AGI can use previous learnt facts and skills to accomplish new tasks in unfamiliar contexts without needing human input.<sup>[1]</sup> Currently, Artifical General Intelligence has not been achieved however it is expected that the first AGI will be achieved. 
                    Researchers such as Russell & Norvig, Poole and Nilsson hold a system of characteristics an AI has to show to be considered an AGI which includes the ability to learn, plan and integrate skills to solve any given problem, even if unfamiliar.<sup>[2]</sup>

                <p>
                    Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) is the highest level of theoretical artificial intelligence. ASI refers to an AI that surpasses the cognitive ability of the brightest and smartest human beings. An Artificial Superintelligence would have the ability to understand human experiences and emotion and would have their own emotions, needs and beliefs. <sup>[1]</sup>
                    ASI is strictly theoretical, both due to technological constraints and due to the potential threat to humanity. One such threat is an intelligence explosions - reseacrhers argue that an ASI could become so intelligence through recursive self-improvement that its intelligence would surpass that of humans exponentially. <sup>[2]</sup>

    <h1 class="display-2 text-center mg-header">Contributions of AI</h1>
    <p class="mg-text text-center">AI has contributed to the modern world heavily, especially with the rise of LLM and Machine learning in the 2020s. The impact of these contributions is heavily debated and depends on the contexts and scenarios being discussed. In some areas, such as education, AI is heavily disputed, with some saying it belongs in an educational environment and some writing it off. For other sectors, AI has allowed for cheaper work, especially with the creation of generative AI models like Sora which can create simple logos, ideas etc. in seconds. Below are some of the positive and negative contributions of AI to society.</p>
